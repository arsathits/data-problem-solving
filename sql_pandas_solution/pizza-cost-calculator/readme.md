## üîç Explanation

1. **Generate combinations:**  
   - All unique sets of 3 toppings are considered.  
   - No topping is repeated in a combination.

2. **Alphabetical order inside pizza:**  
   - Each combination‚Äôs toppings are sorted alphabetically.  
   - E.g., `Chicken,Pepperoni,Sausage` is valid; `Pepperoni,Chicken,Sausage` is not.

3. **Calculate total cost:**  
   - Sum the `ingredient_cost` of the 3 toppings.  
   - Example: `Chicken,Pepperoni,Sausage` ‚Üí `0.55 + 0.50 + 0.70 = 1.75`.

4. **Sort results:**  
   - First by **total_cost descending**.  
   - For ties, sort **alphabetically** by pizza toppings.

## ‚ö° Notes

- SQL can use **self-joins or CTEs** to generate combinations.  
- In Python/Pandas, `itertools.combinations()` with `sum()` is convenient.  
- Ensure toppings within each pizza are always in **alphabetical order** for consistency and tie-breaking.
