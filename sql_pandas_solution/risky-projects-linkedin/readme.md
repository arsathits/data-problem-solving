# ðŸ’¼ Problem 29: Risky Projects (LinkedIn)

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are given datasets containing information about **projects**, **employees**, and their **assignments** to those projects.  
Each project has a defined **budget** and **duration**, while each employee has an **annual salary** and may work on one or more projects.  

Your task is to determine which projects are **overbudget**.  
A project is considered overbudget if the **total prorated salary expenses** of all employees assigned to it **exceed its budget**.

---

## ðŸ§® Calculation Logic

- Each employeeâ€™s salary must be **prorated** based on how long the project lasts relative to a full year.  
  For example:  
  - If a project runs for **6 months**, only **half** of each employeeâ€™s annual salary should count toward that projectâ€™s expenses.
- The prorated salary for each employee on a project is calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{prorated cost} = \text{employee salary} \times \frac{\text{project duration in days}}{365}
  \]
- Sum the prorated costs for all employees assigned to a project to get **total expenses**.
- A project is **overbudget** if:
  \[
  \text{total expenses (rounded up)} > \text{project budget}
  \]

## âœ… Requirements

- Compute project duration as `(end_date - start_date)` in days.
- Prorate each employeeâ€™s annual salary based on the project duration divided by 365.
- Sum prorated salaries for all employees assigned to the same project.
- Round the total expenses **up** to the nearest whole number.
- Return only projects where total expenses **exceed** the projectâ€™s budget.
- Sort the output by `total_expenses` in **descending order**.
- Assume all years have **365 days** (ignore leap years).

## ðŸ’¡ Insight

This analysis helps management identify **risky or overbudget projects** early.  
By comparing prorated employee costs to allocated budgets, companies can take proactive measures such as **resource reallocation**, **budget adjustments**, or **timeline optimizations** to reduce financial risk.
