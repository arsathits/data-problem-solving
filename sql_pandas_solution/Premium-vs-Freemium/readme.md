# ðŸ’Ž Problem 28: Premium vs Freemium Downloads

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

A mobile application tracks downloads made by its users. Each user account can either be a **paying** or **non-paying** customer. You are tasked with generating a report that summarizes the **total number of downloads** for paying and non-paying users **by date**.

The goal is to identify the dates where **non-paying customers have more downloads than paying customers**.

## âœ… Requirements

- Remove any duplicate rows from all input datasets before processing.  
- Perform the necessary joins to connect all three tables:  
  - `ms_acc_dimension` â†’ `ms_user_dimension` on `acc_id`  
  - `ms_user_dimension` â†’ `ms_download_facts` on `user_id`
- For each `date`, calculate:
  - Total downloads for **non-paying** customers.  
  - Total downloads for **paying** customers.
- **Filter** only those dates where non-paying downloads **exceed** paying downloads.
- Sort the final output by `date` in ascending order.
- Output should contain exactly **3 columns**:  
  `date`, `non_paying`, `paying`.
